# SentimentAnalysis

This project aims to delve into people's sentiments regarding the use of AI for therapy. To accomplish this, I gathered posts and comments pertaining to this subject from Reddit-Chatgpt, spanning from November 2022 to July 2023. In total, I acquired 227 submissions related to therapy chatbots, along with a total of 16,814 comments.

For the overall sentiment analysis, I employed the Twitter-roberta model from HuggingFace, which can be accessed here: <<https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest>>.

In this project, I utilized PyABSA for aspect-based sentiment analysis, a valuable tool available at this GitHub repository: <https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA>

Below, you'll find the results of my analysis:
